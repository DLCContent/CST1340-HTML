## Instructions

Basic rundown of the what the website is suppose to be like in the final product. There will be a couple number of pages (not an exact number has been decided yet but roughly 4-6 Webpages); Home, Store, Preview, Checkout (a cart page will be inbuilt to hopefully all the pages instead of being its own seperate page). Since we are only using HTML, CSS and XML/XSL, the website does not have to be fully functional. Below this paragraph, I placed the Coursework requirements so you can easily refer to it while simultaniously working on the repo.

Section 1 – HTML
This section should contain:
•	Annotated screenshots of the first page of your website.
•	Annotated screenshots of the HTML codes used.
•	Annotated screenshots of CSS codes used.

Section 2 – XML
This section should contain:
•	The XML schema including explanation.
•	Annotated screenshot of the XML file.
o	The XML file should include descriptive tag names, attributes, and appropriate information.

Section 3 – Validation
This section should contain:
•	Annotated screenshot of the DTD file that validates the file created in section 2.
o	Marks are awarded for appropriate use of DTD element types (empty, container and data).
o	Marks are awarded for appropriate use of Attributes.
o	Marks are awarded for the appropriate use of Namespaces 
Section 4 - Transformation
•	Annotated screenshots of the XSL/t file that transforms the data in the XML file to an XHTML file.
o	Marks are awarded for use of XSL/t commands.


# Note: These requirements are MANDATORY and must be met in order to achive a high grade. It would be desirable for everyone to be activly participating and adding onto the project for an even contribution.

After a book has been added, a cart popup will show up and u can click on the "Proceed to checkout" Button to be redirected to a formal checkout page. You should also be able to close the pop-up window and proceed with browsing the catelogue.

## Contribution

There are some parts of the contribution that are mandetory and some that will be optional. Each member will be required to get a certain amount of points in order to have an even contribution sheet. This method is also there to track team progress and be fast to identify issues before hand and prevent last minute disasters. 

#### Note: Anything beyond mandetory will not be counted for the Me (group leader) as it could lead to a biased judgement. It is only for you guy's (the group mates) to keep it more or less engaging and hopefully productive. 

### Point-Sheet

(M) For Mandatory for all CW members
(O) For Optional but not required 
(B) Bonus points 

~ +15 - HTML Page (M)
~ +5  - Front-end Design (M)
~ +5  - Validating respective HTML page (M)

~ +3  - Validating other's work (O)
~ +3  - Input with discussing Structure, Design and/or creating templates 

(These points will be awarded only when all group mates agree with the input and it is used in the final product)

This should be it for now, Suggestions from teammates would certainly add onto the contribution.
