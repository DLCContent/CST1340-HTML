## Project Instructions

This website will consist of 4-6 pages (exact number TBD), including:
- Home
- Store
- Preview
- Checkout
  - A cart feature will be integrated into each page, rather than having a separate cart page.

Since we are only using HTML, CSS, and XML/XSL, full functionality is not required. Below, you'll find the coursework requirements for easy reference while working on the project.

### Section 1: HTML
This section should include:
- Annotated screenshots of the first page of your website.
- Annotated screenshots of the HTML code used.
- Annotated screenshots of the CSS code used.

### Section 2: XML
This section should include:
- The XML schema, with an explanation.
- Annotated screenshot of the XML file.
  - The XML file should contain descriptive tag names, attributes, and appropriate content.

### Section 3: Validation
This section should include:
- Annotated screenshot of the DTD file that validates the XML created in Section 2.
  - Points will be awarded for appropriate use of DTD element types (empty, container, and data).
  - Points will be awarded for the appropriate use of attributes.
  - Points will be awarded for the correct use of namespaces.

### Section 4: Transformation
This section should include:
- Annotated screenshots of the XSL/T file that transforms the XML data into an XHTML file.
  - Points will be awarded for correct use of XSL/T commands.

> **Note**: These requirements are **mandatory** to achieve a high grade. Active participation from everyone is essential for a balanced contribution to the project.

- The store page will display books sorted by genre in a horizontal scrollable row. 
- Hovering over a book will reveal an "Add to Cart" button.

### Cart Pop-up Menu

![Cart Pop-up](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0339a7e2-0d51-426a-a014-d7a115192888)

- When a book is added to the cart, a pop-up will appear with a "Proceed to Checkout" button to redirect to the checkout page.
- Users can also close the pop-up and continue browsing the catalogue.

## Contribution

Each member will be required to earn a certain number of points to ensure an even contribution. This system helps track team progress, identify potential issues early, and avoid last-minute problems.

#### **Note**: Anything beyond the mandatory contributions will not count towards my (group leader's) points, as this could result in biased judgment. These contributions are only for group members to keep the project engaging and productive.

### Points Breakdown

- **+15** – HTML Page (M)
- **+5** – Front-end Design (M)
- **+5** – Validating HTML Page (M)
- **+3** – Validating Others' Work (O)
- **+3** – Input on Structure, Design, or Template Creation (O)
  - Points for input will only be awarded when all group members agree and the input is incorporated into the final product.

This is the initial plan, and suggestions from team members will be considered to enhance the contribution list.
